# Stationery Sales Dashboard

### Project Overview

This is a data visualization project focused on analyzing stationery sales. The goal was to build a comprehensive dashboard that answers key business questions, such as:

* Which products are performing best in terms of revenue?
* What are the sales trends over time?
* Which days or periods are our most successful for sales?

This repository contains the core components of the project, including the raw data and the final dashboard as a static PDF.

### Project Files

This repository contains the following files:

* `sales_data.csv`: This is the raw dataset used for the project. It contains all the sales records, including the date, product name, units sold, and unit price. This is the foundation of the entire project.

* `Stationery_Sales_Dashboard.pdf`: This is a static, non-interactive overview of the final dashboard. It provides a visual snapshot of the key charts and metrics, including the total revenue, top products by revenue, and units sold over time. This file is useful for a quick review of the project's output.

* `Project Link.pdf`: This file contains a direct link to the live, interactive Google Looker Studio dashboard. This is the main deliverable of the project. By clicking this link, you can use the interactive filters to explore the data for yourself and gain deeper insights.
